### Project Description
#### NLP Disaster Detection Mini Project

##### Step 1: Brief description of the problem and data
Our goal is to try to accurately identify real disasters in tweets.  This is a binary clasification problem, which we will attempt to use Recurrant Neural Networks to solve.

We are using the nlp-getting-started database from Kaggle.  The data has the following columns:
- id - a unique identifier for each tweet
- text - the text of the tweet
- location - the location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)
- keyword - a particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)
- target - in train.csv only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (1) or not (0)
